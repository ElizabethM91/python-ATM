## <div align="center"> 💷💰 ATM Machine 💰💷 </div>

### 🚀 Overview
This repository contains a Python program simulate the behaviour of an ATM machine. 

### ✅ Requirements
To run this simulation you will need to use the Python file in your favourite code editor. As this is a simple simulation the pin and balance is already set within the code.

### 👩‍💻 Python Code
I took steps in creating a simple simulation in Python of an ATM Machine. The ATM allows users to perform basic banking transactions, checking the balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and simply exiting the system.

#### 🕶️ Features  
> **1. User Authentication** - The user is asked for their pin to access the menu, if it is incorrect, the user will be asked to try again  
> **2. Main Menu** - When the pin is entered correctly the user is directed to the main menu. They will have a set of options to choose from, checking their balance, depositing, withdrawing and exiting the system.  
> **3. Error Handling** - Ensures the user cannot withdraw more money than they have. We also ensure that the right menu selection is used and if not the user is asked again for the right selection.  

#### 🔨 Code Structure
> **Predefined User Details** - The pin and balance are predefined for simplicity.  
> **Functions** -  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`balance()`:** Displays users current balance.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`deposit()`:** Asks the user to enter an amount and then updates the balance.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`withdraw()`:** Asks the user how much they would like to withdraw, checks if available and then updates the balance.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`exit()`:** Prints a goodbye message and exits.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`pinCheck()`:** Verfiies the user's pin before the main menu is displayed.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`mainMenu()`:** The main menu with selections for the user to select from.
